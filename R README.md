# Overview
For this project I wanted to be better at analizying large databases and finding trends in said data. 
I also wanted to present it in an organized fashion such as a line plot or bar graph. 

The software that I ended up writing was a program that emulated housing prices and interest rates. the rates are set in the program 
and the results display on a linegraph. 

The purpose for writing this program was to get a better idea on how to work with R and realize the potential of coding to research and analize data. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
